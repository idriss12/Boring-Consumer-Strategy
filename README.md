# Boring-Consumer-Strategy
The Boring Consumer strategy is a strategy based  for individual stocks. It uses the close of the previous day, the gap between the previous day and the current day. 
This strategy concerns only the stock market. I use the yahoo finance database to extract one of the stock in the list of assets that belong to the S&P 500.
